Predicting EV Sales in the Top 10 GDP Countries

Files Provided:
1) finalProject.ipynb file
   =>open google drive, google collab
2)In google collab to the left side upload the file sales_historical_cars.csv file it has
  all the data we are working with. Make sure you upload the file again in the google collab
  once you close as after the runtime the .csv file is deleted. One has to manually upload
  it again to run the cells in google collab. 

We first gathered the data(downloaded the data from kaggle)
Used pandas for data cleaning and filtering
The main idea was to predict the EV sales in the top 10 GDP countries for 2024
for that we predicted the percentage for 2023 and calculated the precision and error rate 
for our predicted 2023 and actual 2023. It turned out our prediction had high precision and low 
error rate. 
So, we confidentely predicted the 2024 rate.
